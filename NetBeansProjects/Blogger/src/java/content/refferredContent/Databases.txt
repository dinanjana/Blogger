Databases and database systems are an essential component of life in modern society: most of us encounter several activities every day that involve some interaction with a database. For example, if we go to the bank to deposit or withdraw funds, if we make a hotel or airline reservation,if we access a computerized library catalog to search for a bibliographic item, or if we purchase something onlineâ??such as a book, toy, or computerâ??chances are that our activities will involve someone or some computer program accessing a database. Even purchasing items at a supermarket often automatically updates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items. These interactions are examples of what we may call traditional database applications, in which most of the information that is stored and accessed is either textual or numeric. In the past few years, advances in technology have led to exciting new applications of database systems. New media technology has made it possible to store images,audio clips,and video streams digitally.These types of files are becoming an important component of multimedia databases. Geographic information systems (GIS) can store and analyze maps, weather data, and satellite images. Data warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are used in many companies to extract and analyze useful business information from very large databases to support decision making. Real-time and active database technology is used to control industrial and manufacturing processes. And database search techniques are being applied to the World Wide Web to improve the search for information that is needed by users browsing the Internet. To understand the fundamentals of database technology, however, we must start from the basics of traditional database applications.In Section 1.1we start by defining a database, and then we explain other basic terms. In Section 1.2, we provide a
